# Pokemon android
## Building project
Either use your favorite IDE with some recent gradle support or use the following in a terminal (linux example).


```
# Make sure the ANDROID_HOME variable points to your Sdk.
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk
/path/to/gradle-version/bin/gradle assembleRelease
```

This project is currently not compiling even though the legacy project worked just fine in both eclipse + ADT plugin and Android Studio import.  
Any Help on the android toolchain is appreciated.
